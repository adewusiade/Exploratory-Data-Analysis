# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This project contains the exploratory data analysis, chi-square analysis, and analysis of variance of various datasets using R. 
Exploratory data analysis is an essential step in many types of research but is of particular use when. The tools described in this report should present the data and help any user to better understand the features of a dataset and also to generate novel hypotheses. The EDA in this research shows the descriptive statistics and exploratory graphs of the baseball data. The result shows that Runs Allowed and Runs Scored have the highest average values, and there exists a strong correlation between some of the variables such as OBP and RS, OBP and SLG, OBP and BA, BA and SLG, RA and OOBP, and RA and OOSLG. while others show a negative correlation.
